# Remote_Keyless_Entry(RKE)

* Remote keyless entry (RKE) is a remote-control electronic access system. RKEs,which are generally used to remotely lock or unlock doors,require the end user to take a specific     action that causes a physical or software key fob to send a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock. A button on a physical fob or a mobile app is often       pressed. In contrast to remote keyless entry, which is often employed to secure vehicles from theft, passive keyless entry (PKE) does not involve any activity on the end user's   part.
* Since the mid-1990s, modern systems have used encryption and rotating entry codes to prevent auto thieves from intercepting and faking the signal.Each time the lock is accessed,   a controller chip in the receiver alters the exact frequency necessary for RKE, a security feature known as rolling code or hopping code.
